<p>EVOLUTION OF THE SCHOOLS & ITS PURPOSE<br></p>


<p>Education aims the rearing up of disciplined, efficient and God fearing citizens. All the above qualities are of paramount importance as far as individual as well as national life is concerned. The need of the hour is to bring up good citizens; who would put others interests before their own interests and would willingly contribute their mite for the well being of the fellow citizens. It is with these noble ideals in mind that the school was founded in 11th June 1979 by Chevalier T THOMAS, the Founder, to impart quality education to the children of the lower middle class families. Marian Sr. Sec. School is a co-educational English Medium School affiliated to the Central Board of Secondary Education, New Delhi and located in a campus on K.K. Road, Kalathipady, 5 km away from Kottayam town..<br><br></p>
<p>The school was started with 11 students and 3 teachers in a rented building. We have been able to attain tremendous growth within a short span of time and now we have classes upto Std. XII and 1700 students and their academic requirements are met by a team of eminently qualified and dedicated teachers. Attention to the individual is ensured by restricting the  number of students in a class. An effort to upgrade the faculty is made by deputing teachers to refresher  programmes.<br><br></p>
<p>We have sent 23 batches of Std. XII children and 28 batches of Std X. This year also we have produced 100% result in Std. XII and Std. X. Out of 80 students in Std. XII, 31 secured distinctions, 46  first class and the rest second class.</p>
